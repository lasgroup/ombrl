# OMBRL: Optimistic Exploration in Model-based RL
This is an open-source implementation of algorithms for optimistic exploration in model-based RL settings, based on the [MaxInfoRL](https://github.com/sukhijab/maxinforl) repository, which in turn is based on [jaxrl](https://github.com/ikostrikov/jaxrl). Among others, you will find an implementation of the COMBRL algorithm from our paper [Link with title](https://example.org) and the SoftAE algorithm from our paper [Link with title](). This repository is currently under construction, so be sure to check back soon - more info to come!

## Installation:

1. First install the jaxrl library from tha attached folder with pip.
2. Install maxinforl after that.
3. Install this repo.
4. Maybe, install JAX[GPU] manually.
